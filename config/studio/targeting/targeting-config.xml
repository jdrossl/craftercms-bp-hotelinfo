    <!-- targeting-config.xml

    This file configures the targeting system of Crafter Studio to help provide
    Crafter Engine with fake user properties that help drive the targeting system.

    Pages, components, search, services and more can respond differently depeneding
    on the user properties, and content delivery can be very personalized based
    on user properties. In order to test and validate the experience, this file can
    help set these properties as KVP (key-value-pairs) that are then injected into
    the Crafter Engine's session and are made accessible using the Profile APIs.

    You can learn more about personalization and targeting here:
